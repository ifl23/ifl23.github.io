# CALL FOR PAPERS:

The 35th Symposium on Implementation and Application of Functional Languages (IFL 2023)

Braga, Portugal, August 29th-August 31st, 2023

## Important dates

Draft paper submission:      July   31st, 2023 
Draft paper notification:    August  1st, 2023
Early registration deadline: August 11th, 2023
Late registration deadline:  August 23rd, 2023
Symposium:                   August 29th - August 31st (3 days)

## Scope

The goal of the IFL symposia is to bring together researchers actively
engaged in the implementation and application of functional and
function-based programming languages. IFL 2022 will be a venue for
researchers to present and discuss new ideas and concepts, work in
progress, and publication-ripe results related to the implementation
and application of functional languages and function-based
programming.

Topics of interest to IFL include, but are not limited to:

* language concepts
* type systems, type checking, type inferencing
* compilation techniques
* staged compilation
* run-time function specialization
* run-time code generation
* partial evaluation
* abstract interpretation
* metaprogramming
* generic programming
* automatic program generation
* array processing
* concurrent/parallel programming
* concurrent/parallel program execution
* embedded systems
* web applications
* embedded domain specific languages
* security
* novel memory management techniques
* run-time profiling performance measurements
* debugging and tracing
* virtual/abstract machine architectures
* validation, verification of functional programs
* tools and programming techniques
* industrial applications

## Submissions and peer-review

Following IFL tradition, IFL 2023 will use a post-symposium review
process to produce the formal proceedings.

Before the symposium authors submit draft papers. These draft papers
will be screened by the program chair to make sure that they are
within the scope of IFL. The draft papers will be made available to
all participants at the symposium. Each draft paper is presented by
one of the authors at the symposium. Notice that it is a requirement
that accepted draft papers are presented physically at the symposium.

After the symposium, a formal review process will take place,
conducted by the program committee.  Reviewing is single blind. There
will be at least 3 reviews per paper. The reviewers have 6 weeks to
write their reviews. For the camera-ready version the authors can make
minor revisions which are accepted without further reviewing.

Contributions submitted for the draft paper deadline must be between
two and twelve pages long. For submission details, please consult the
IFL 2023 website at https://ifl23.github.io/ .

## Where

IFL 2023 will be held physically in Braga, Portugal, arranged by
University of Minho.
